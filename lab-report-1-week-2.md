**Step 2- Remotely Connecting**

You can connect to your ieng6 from your own device from the terminal line in VS Code, but first you must install the program OpenSSH [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). Your password must be activated with your school info at [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). After install and password activation open a new terminal using the tab at the top in VSCode and use the ssh along with your course specific username that ends with @ieng6@ucsd.edu.
